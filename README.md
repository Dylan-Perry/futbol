# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

# Check-in Plan
- We plan to have one daily check-in at the earliest time that works for each of us; generally when project work time begins.
- We'll have as-needed afternoon check-ins to check our progress and determine any blockers before we go solo for the rest of each evening.

# Project Organization and Workflow Plan
1. Our plan is to divvy up methods between each of us, and track our work on each method using a GitHub Projects kanban board. 
2. As we complete method(s), we'll make pull requests for their branches and request review on the PR's from our group mates. Within each method on the kanban board, we'll link to the PR containing/completing that method.

# Different Approaches Discussion Summary
We were already aligned on how we wanted to approach the project (reflected above), so our discussion was really just about which tool(s) to use. We landed on GitHub Projects because none of us had used it before, and we thought it might synergize nicely with the rest of the project, since most of our work will be stored on GitHub.

# Approach to Code Design Discussion Summary
Our first steps were to work together synchronously to store the CSV data in an accessible way. Once this "platform" was built, we assigned the various methods to each group member to complete asynchronously, with daily check-ins to ensure we were progressing smoothly, and to discuss any potential blockers.
